 * The External Clients were translated to Scala but this class was not.
 * Because some of the services are working (no longer exist, unavailable) this tester was not deleted.
 * But it contain now only the calling for the not tanslated clients.
 * As result of client's problems, this tester is no more working.
 *
 * There are no AnnotationClientsTester implemented in scala yet. One can test each client running its scala class.
 * They can be found at: eval/src/main/java/org/dbpedia/spotlight/evaluation/external/
