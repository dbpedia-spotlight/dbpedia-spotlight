architecture	Adile_Sultan_Palace	Adile Sultan Palace is a former royal residence , which was used later as a school building, and is a cultural centre today located in Kandilli neighbourhood of Istanbul , Turkey . History The palace was built for the Ottoman princess Adile Sultan (1825-1898), the daughter of Sultan Mahmud II (1785-1839) and the sister of the Sultans Abdülmecid I (1823-1861) and Abdülaziz (1830-1876), by the legendary Ottoman Armenian architect Sarkis Balyan . It was erected on the same place of a kiosk , which was presented to her by Sultan Abdülmecid in 1856. The palace was commissioned by Sultan Abdülaziz and built by the renowned court architect Sarkis Balyan in 1861. It stands at one of the most glorious places, on a hill, which is a headland in the middle of Bosphorus on the Asia n shore. This location enables a wonderful panoramic view of Bosphorus reaching from Sea of Marmara to Black Sea seen out of all the rooms in three sides of the building. The palace with 55 rooms was on a ground of 17,000 m². Adile Sultan, a great and the only Turkish royal female poet having a Diwan , lived here until the death of her husband Mehmet Ali
architecture	1548	History The Şehzade Mosque was commissioned by Sultan Suleiman I in memory of his eldest son by Hürrem, Prince Mehmet, who died of smallpox at the age of 21 in 1543, though the cause for his death is disputed. It was the first major commission by the Imperial Architect Mimar Sinan, and was completed in 1548. It is considered by architectural historians as Sinan's first masterpiece of classical Ottoman architecture.

The caves in the Bükk have many stalagmites and stalactites.
architecture	Andrea_Doria	A chapel was later built over the remains of the mosque and the whole area became known as the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe (). A statue of the Virgin and Child was installed in there in the 15th century. The statue was quite small, only two feet in height, carved in wood and polychromed in royal red, blue and gold. The Virgin was seated in a simple chair, with the Child Jesus on her lap. Both were crowned and the Virgin held in her right hand a sceptre with three flowers denoting Love, Truth and Justice. The shrine prospered in fame and popularity, for well over two centuries. Ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar saluted Our Lady as they passed Europa Point and mariners often came ashore with offerings for Our Lady. Notable gifts include a silver lamp, given in 1568 by Giovanni Andrea Doria (great-nephew of the great Genoese admiral Andrea Doria), and two massive silver lamps presented by John of Austria, upon his victory at the Battle of Lepanto.

The $850 million "mixed-use" district is one of the largest development projects in the Midwestern United States The Power & Light District is one of only a few places in the United States where possession and consumption of open containers of alcoholic beverages are allowed on the street, although they remain prohibited on the street throughout the rest of Kansas City.
architecture	Affordable_housing	Architecture The building's design has been called a "Queen Anne splendor," a style represented by the Woolley House's massive bay windows and projecting roof masses. The design of the house is reminiscent of Wright's first teacher Joseph Silsbee and typical of Wright's early, low-cost residential designs. On the home's southeast portion are its polygonal bay windows and due to a restoration the rough stone foundation walls are more enhanced than they once were. The original horizontal wooden clapboarding has been restored as well. In this early Wright work the influence of Silsbee and the Arts and Crafts movement are heavily embedded in the design, which reflects Wright's passion for designing affordable housing. The federal historic district was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 1973.
architecture	1571	Both the use of the giant order and this decorative richness are twin traits peculiar to Palladio's language in the last decade of his life. However, the chromatic contrast between the white of the stone and the red of the brick (even though desired by Palladio in the Convento della Carità in Venice) is only the product of the original surfaces' degradation: ample remains of the light stucco which once covered the bricks are still quite visible, just below the great Composite capitals. Palazzo del Capitaniato, section (drawing by , 1776). The Palladian loggia substituted an analogous, structure which had stood on the same site from the Middle Ages, and which had already been reconstructed at least twice during the Cinquecento: a covered public loggia on the ground floor and an audience hall on the upper storey. The new construction became economically viable in April 1571 and works began immediately. Palladio supplied the last drawings for the moulding templates in March 1572 and by the end of that year the building was roofed if Giannantonio Fasolo could paint the lacunars of the audience hall and Lorenzo Rubini execute the stuccoes and statues.
architecture	1852	The house was bought in 1820 by Sir Henry Russell, Chief Justice of Bengal in India, who employed William Atkinson to undertake many adaptations and alterations to the house. Internally, little of Talman's house survives as a result of these changes. A new staircase was installed, which resulted in the removal of a carved cornice made for the Earl of Clarendon by Grinling Gibbons. In 1852 the house was inherited by his son, Sir Charles Russell VC.

biology	Annual_plant	Stylidium candelabrum is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the genus Stylidium (family Stylidiaceae). It is an erect annual plant that grows from 6 to 20 cm tall. Elliptical leaves, about 11-100 per plant, are scattered along the stem. The leaves are generally 2.5-18 mm long and 1.5-9 mm wide. This species generally has 1-13 scapes and cymose inflorescences that are 3-16 cm long. Flowers are white. S. candelabrum is endemic to the northernmost area of the Northern Territory in Australia and much of its range is within a national park and therefore has been evaluated to be neither rare nor threatened. Its typical habitat is shallow sand associated with sandstone pavements and it appears to prefer areas with higher rainfall. It flowers in the southern hemisphere from March to July. Its conservation status has been assessed as secure.

biology	Apoptosis	This gene encodes a highly conserved neurotrophic factor. The recombinant form of this protein was shown to promote the survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in culture, and was able to prevent apoptosis of motor neurons induced by axotomy. The encoded protein is processed to a mature secreted form that exists as a homodimer. The mature form of the protein is a ligand for the product of the RET (rearranged during transfection) protooncogene. In addition to the transcript encoding GDNF, two additional alternative transcripts encoding distinct proteins, referred to as astrocyte-derived trophic factors, have also been described. Mutations in this gene may be associated with Hirschsprung's disease.
biology	Alpha_taxonomy	 In taxonomy, the Sphaeropleales are an order of green algae that used to be called Chlorococcales. This order includes vegetatively non-motile unicellular or colonial taxa that have biflagellate zoospores with flagella that are directly opposed in direction (the DO arrangement): Sphaeroplea, Atractomorpha, Neochloris, Hydrodictyon, and Pediastrum. All of these taxa have basal body core connections.
biology	Allele	Considering the second manner of outbreeding depressing cited above, individuals from Population A will tend to have alleles selected for the quality of combining well with allele combinations common in Population A. However, alleles found in Population A will not have been selected for the quality of crossing well with alleles common in Population B. Therefore outbreeding can undermine vitality by reducing positive epistasis and/or increasing negative epistasis. The sterility and other fitness-reducing effects often seen in interspecific hybrids (such as mules) can be considered an extreme case of this type of outbreeding depression, involving not only different alleles of the same gene (as in distinct populations of a single species) but even different orthologous genes.
biology	Adaina_perplexus	 Adaina perplexus is a moth of the Pterophoridae family. It is found in North America , including the Everglades . The wingspan is about 14 mm. The head is pale ochreous-brown. The antennae are whitish annulated with pale brown above. The thorax and abdomen are whitish, the latter usually with a black point on the posterior edge of each segment above, and with a similar series on the sides which may form a patch on the sixth segment. The forewings are creamy-white shaded with pale ochreous-brown and sprinkled with dark brown atoms, some of which form distinct spots. The fringes are dusky. The hindwings are uniform pale smoky, the fringes paler. Taxonomy Some authors list Adaina perplexus as a synonym of Adaina ambrosiae . Category:Animals described in 1917 Category:Pterophoridae

Narrow ultra vires applies if an administrator did not have the substantive power to make a decision or it was wrought with procedural defects. Broad ultra vires applies if there is an abuse of power (e.g., Wednesbury unreasonableness or bad faith) or a failure to exercise an administrative discretion (e.g., acting at the behest of another or unlawfully applying a government policy). Either doctrine may entitle a claimant to various prerogative writs, equitable remedies or statutory orders if they are satisfied.

chemistry	Acetone	Chlorobutanol is formed by the simple nucleophilic addition of chloroform and acetone. The reaction is base driven by potassium or sodium hydroxide. Recently, Jawwad & Kashif have prepared Chlorobutanol from chloroform and acetone under phase-transfer catalyzed conditions in high yields.
chemistry	Alkyne	Scheme 1. The Prins reactionThe Prins reaction is an organic reaction consisting of an electrophilic addition of an aldehyde or ketone to an alkene or alkyne followed by capture of a nucleophile. The outcome of the reaction depends on reaction conditions (scheme 1). With water and a protic acid such as sulfuric acid as the reaction medium and formaldehyde the reaction product is a 1,3-diol. When water is absent dehydration takes place to an allyl alcohol. With an excess of formaldehyde and a low reaction temperature the reaction product is a dioxane. When water is replaced by acetic acid the corresponding esters are formed.

chemistry	Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene	Plastic tubing is widely used for its light weight, chemical resistance, non-corrosive properties, and ease of making connections. Plastic materials include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), fibre reinforced plastic (FRP), reinforced polymer mortar (RPMP), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), cross-linked high-density polyethylene (PEX), polybutylene (PB), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), for example. In many countries, PVC pipes account for most pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for drinking water distribution and wastewater mains.
chemistry	Amino_acid	Between 1899 and 1908 Fischer made his great contributions to knowledge of the proteins. He sought effective analytical methods of separating and identifying the individual amino acids, discovering a new type, the cyclic amino acids: proline and hydroxyproline. He also studied the synthesis of proteins by obtaining the various amino acids in an optically active form in order to unite them. He was able to establish the type of bond that would connect them together in chains, namely, the peptide bond, and by means of this he obtained the dipeptides and later the tripeptides and polypeptides. In 1901 he discovered, in collaboration with Ernest Fourneau, the synthesis of the dipeptide, glycylglycine, and in that year he also published his work on the hydrolysis of casein. Amino acids occurring in nature were prepared in the laboratory and new ones were discovered. His synthesis of the oligopeptides culminated in an octodecapeptide, which had many characteristics of natural proteins. This and his subsequent work led to a better understanding of the proteins and laid the foundations for later studies of them.
chemistry	Alkylation	Petrochemical industry Synthetic zeolites are widely used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry, for instance in fluid catalytic cracking and hydro-cracking. Zeolites confine molecules in small spaces, which causes changes in their structure and reactivity. The hydrogen form of zeolites (prepared by ion-exchange) are powerful solid-state acids, and can facilitate a host of acid-catalyzed reactions, such as isomerisation, alkylation, and cracking. The specific activation modality of most zeolitic catalysts used in petrochemical applications involves quantum-chemical Lewis acid site reactions.
chemistry	Amine_gas_treating	Rectisol, like Selexol and Purisol, is a physical solvent, unlike amine based acid gas removal solvents that rely on a chemical reaction with the acid gases. Methanol as a solvent is inexpensive compared to the proprietary Selexol and Purisol solvents. The Rectisol process requires more electrical energy for refrigeration to maintain the low temperatures required but it also requires less steam energy for regeneration. Although capital costs for methanol solvent (Rectisol) units are higher than proprietary solvent units, methanol as a cold, physical solvent can remove greater percentages of acid gas components providing a higher purity cleaned gas.
chemistry	Acetaldehyde	Synthesis and reactions Iodoform was first prepared by Georges Serrulas in 1822 and its molecular formula was identified by Jean-Baptiste Dumas in 1834. It is synthesized in the haloform reaction by the reaction of iodine and sodium hydroxide with any one of these four kinds of organic compounds: (i) a methyl ketone: CH3COR, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and certain secondary alcohols (CH3CHROH, where R is an alkyl or aryl group).
chemistry	Anaerobic_organism	Sources of methane for human use Natural gas fields The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields. It is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels, and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen. The gas at shallow levels (low pressure) forms by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, sediments buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil generate natural gas. Methane is also produced in considerable quantities from the decaying organic wastes of solid waste landfills.

chemistry	Acyl_chloride	Another use for PBr3 is as a catalyst for the α-bromination of carboxylic acids. Although acyl bromides are rarely made in comparison with acyl chlorides, they are used as intermediates in Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation. Initially PBr3 reacts with the carboxylic acid to form the acyl bromide, which is more reactive towards bromination. The overall process can be represented as
chemistry	Alcohol_abuse	Nongenetic factors such as alcohol abuse, excess iron, and others listed above can increase the demand for heme and the enzymes required to make heme. The combination of this increased demand and reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase disrupts heme production and allows byproducts of the process to accumulate in the body, triggering the signs and symptoms of porphyria cutanea tarda.
chemistry	Alcohol	Coordinating solvents such as ether or THF, are required to solvate (complex) the magnesium(II) center. The solvent must be aprotic since alcohols and water react with phenylmagnesium bromide to give benzene. Carbonyl-containing solvents such as acetone and ethyl acetate are incompatible with the reagent.

computer	Ambiguous_grammar	Purpose A (natural language) text can be enriched with meta-information by the application of a RTN with output; for instance, a RTN inserting XML tags can be used for transforming a plain text into a structured XML document. A RTN with output representing a natural language grammar would delimit and add the syntactic structure of each text sentence (see parsing). Other RTNs with output could simply mark text segments containing relevant information (see information extraction). The application of a RTN with output representing an ambiguous grammar results in a set of possible translations or interpretations of the input. Computing this set has an exponential worst-case cost, even for an Earley parser for RTNs with output, due to cases in which the number of translations increases exponentially w.r.t. the input length; for instance, the number of interpretations of a natural language sentence increases exponentially w.r.t. the number of unresolved prepositional phrase attachments: in sentence the girl saw the monkey with the telescope, it is unknown whether the girl used the telescope or the monkey was holding it (21 interpretations), in sentence the girl saw the monkey with the telescope in the garden, it is also unknown whether the monkey was in the garden

economy	Bituminous_coal	The 1899 and 1900 strikes The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) had won a sweeping victory in the 1897 strike by the soft-coal (bituminous coal) miners in the Midwest, winning significant wage increases and growing from 10,000 to 115,000 members. A number of small strikes took place in the anthracite district from 1899 to 1901, by which the labor union gained experience and unionized more workers. The 1899 strike in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, demonstrated that the unions could win a strike directed against a subsidiary of one of the large railroads. It hoped to make similar gains in 1900, but found the operators, who had established an oligopoly through concentration of ownership after drastic fluctuations in the market for anthracite, to be far more determined opponents than it had anticipated. The owners refused to meet or to arbitrate with the union; the union struck on September 17, 1900, with results that surprised even the union, as miners of all different nationalities walked out in support of the union.

economy	Benito_Mussolini	of an effective land reform, heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the South, together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods in order to boost the northern industry, made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers, and small business and land owners. Multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living, especially from 1892 to 1921. In addition, the surge of brigandage and mafia provoked widespread violence, corruption and illegality. Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti once conceded that places existed "where the law does not operate at all". After the rise of Benito Mussolini, the "Iron Prefect" Cesare Mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flowering in the South with some degree of success. However, when connections between mafia and the Fascists emerged, Mori was removed and the Fascist propaganda declared the mafia defeated. Economically, Fascist policy aimed at the creation of an Italian empire and Southern Italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies. Naples enjoyed a demographic and economic rebirth, mainly thanks to the interest of the King Victor Emmanuel III who was born there. Starting from the 1950s, the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno was set up

He advocates a 50% tax on advertising to counter-attack what he calls "An active propaganda machinery controlled by the world's largest corporations constantly reassures us that consumerism is the path to happiness, governmental restraint of market excess is the cause of our distress, and economic globalization is both a historical inevitability and a boon to the human species."

economy	Bangladesh	Policy In Singapore, the term immigrant workers is separated into foreign workers and foreign talents. Foreign workers refers to semi-skilled or unskilled workers who mainly work in the manufacturing, construction, and domestic services sectors. The majority of them come from countries such as India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Thailand, as part of bilateral agreements between Singapore and these countries (Yeoh 2007). Foreign talents refers to foreigners with professional qualifications or acceptable degrees working at the higher end of Singapore's economy. The Singaporean government has carefully constructed a system under which different types of employment passes are issued to immigrant workers according to their qualifications and monthly salaries. The “P, Q, R” employment-pass system was put into practice since September 1998; a new “S” type employment pass was later introduced in July 2004. The government has also set different policies on recruiting foreign talents and foreign workers.

economy	Academic_publishing	International rankings According to the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Iran increased its academic publishing output nearly tenfold from 1996 to 2004, and has been ranked first globally in terms of output growth rate (followed by China with a 3 fold increase). In comparison, the only G8 countries in top 20 ranking with fastest performance improvement are, Italy which stands at tenth and Canada at 13th globally. Iran's growth rate in science and technology is 11 times more than the average growth of the world's output in 2009 and in terms of total output per year, Iran has already surpassed the total scientific output of countries like Sweden, Switzerland, Israel, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Austria or that of Norway. Iran with a science and technology yearly growth rate of 25% is doubling its total output every three years and at this rate will reach the level of Canadian annual output in 2017. The report further notes that Iran's scientific capability build-up has been the fastest in the past two decades and that this build-up is in part due to the Iraqi invasion of Iran, the subsequent bloody Iran Iraq war and Iran's high casualties due to the international sanctions in effect on Iran
economy	Antoninianus	The denarius continued to decline slowly in purity, with a notable reduction instituted by Septimius Severus. This was followed by the introduction of a double denarius piece, differentiated from the denarius by the radiate crown worn by the emperor. The coin is commonly called the antoninianus by numismatists after the emperor Caracalla, who introduced the coin in early in 215. Although nominally valued at two denarii, the antoninianus never contained more than 1.6 times the amount of silver of the denarius. The profit of minting a coin valued at two denarii, but weighing only about one and a half times as much is obvious; the reaction to these coins by the public is unknown. As the number of antoniniani minted increased, the number of denarii minted decreased, until the denarius ceased to be minted in significant quantities by the middle of the third century. Again, coinage saw its greatest debasement during times of war and uncertainty. The second half of the third century was rife with this war and uncertainty, and the silver content of the antonianus fell to only 2%, losing almost an appearance of being silver. During this time the aureus remained slightly more stable, before it too became

economy	Ark_Hills	 (ジェトロ　JETRO) is an independent government agency established by Japan Export Trade Research Organization as a nonprofit corporation in Osaka in February 1951, and reorganized as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in 1958 (later Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry or METI) to consolidate Japan's efforts in export promotion. The government has provided more than half of JETRO's annual operating budget. As of 1989, JETRO maintained seventy-eight offices in fifty-seven countries, as well as thirty offices in Japan, with a total staff of 1,200. Its main office is located in the Ark Mori Building in Akasaka, Tokyo. Initially, JETRO's activities focused mainly on promoting exports to other countries. As exporters established themselves in world markets and the balance of trade turned from deficit to surplus, however, JETRO's role shifted to encompass more varied activities. These have included the furtherance of mutual understanding with trading partners, import promotion, liaison between small businesses in Japan and their overseas counterparts, and data dissemination. Import promotion services have included publications, promotion of trade fairs, seminars, and trade missions.
economy	Anthony_Trollope	The decimalisation movement even entered fiction. In Anthony Trollope's Palliser novels (and more so in the television series based on them), Plantagenet Palliser is a passionate advocate of decimalisation, a cause the other characters seem to find intensely boring. Palliser's scheme would have divided the shilling into ten (presumably revalued) pennies. This would have changed the threepence into 2.5 new pence, the sixpence into fivepence and the half crown into a two shilling, five pence piece. It would also have required the withdrawal and reissuance of the existing copper coinage. At the end of the fifth book in the series, Prime Minister, Palliser (now Duke of Omnium) muses that the reform will not be accomplished, since it can only be done by a Chancellor of the Exchequer sitting in the House of Commons, and the Duke now sits in the House of Lords.

economy	BRICS	Should South Africa be a BRIC? China, the Asian giant, has recently invited South Africa, to join the BRIC economic group and to participate at its latest meeting held in Beijing. The intention of making the extra room for the new member was to tighten Chinese ties with the largest African economy which after all ended up adding the letter “S” to the BRIC acronym creating a new block of countries called BRICS. In fact, the incorporation of South Africa to the BRIC concept was a matter of time, since there were already existing ties with Brazil and India through the group known as IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa). The linkage became an important strategic point connecting the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean through South Africa and opens a gateway for African markets. Jim O'Neill (chief economist at Goldman Sachs) said in his statement that the poor demographics of South Africa (45 million compared to 180 million in Nigeria: accounting for 18 percent of the total African continent) is not enough to become a BRIC member (total conglomeration of about 2,834 million: China with 1,338 million; India 1,157 million, Brazil 199 million and Russia 140 million.

The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments. Furthermore, some charities such as ActionAid have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees. Under the de-inflated figures, the EU as a whole did not reach its internal aid target in 2006 and is expected not to reach the international target of 0.7% of gross national income until 2015.

The Amsterdam School movement is part of international Expressionist architecture , sometimes linked to German Brick Expressionism . In German Brick Expressionism important expressionist buildings are excluded, such as the famous Einstein Tower in Potsdam by Erich Mendelsohn (white plaster) and the Philharmonie in Berlin by Hans Scharoun (yellow facade). These two buildings are related to international Expressionist architecture.

Further examples of international Expressionist architecture are: the P.L.Takstraat Housing Estate in Amsterdam by Piet Kramer (red brick), the Goetheanum in Dornach by Rudolf Steiner (grey concrete) and the Casa Milà in Barcelona by Antoni Gaudi (grey stone).

They are usually olive green in color, may have some brownish spots and have three veins down the length of the leaf.

In Spain and the Spanish Harlem they are popularly consumed with beer. In Lebanon, salty and chilled Lupini Beans are called "Termos" and are served pre-meal as part of an aperitif. The Andean variety of this bean is from the Andean Lupin (tarwi, L. mutabilis) and was a widespread food in the Incan Empire. The Andean Lupin and the Mediterranean L. albus (White Lupin), L. angustifolius (Blue Lupin), and Lupinus hirsutus are also edible after soaking the seeds for some days in salted water. Lupins were also used by Native Americans in North America, e.g., the Yavapai people. Lupins are known as altramuz in Spain and Argentina. In Portuguese the lupin beans are known as tremoços, and in Antalya (Turkey) as tirmis. Edible lupins are referred to as sweet lupins because they contain smaller amounts of toxic alkaloids than the bitter lupin varieties. Newly bred variants of sweet lupins are grown extensively in Germany; they lack any bitter taste and require no soaking in salt solution. The seeds are used for different foods from vegan sausages to lupin-tofu or baking-enhancing lupin flour.

food	Australasia	 The Chaozhou people (commonly known as Teochew) are Han people who are native to the Chaoshan region of eastern Guangdong province of China and speak the Teochew dialect. The Teochew diaspora can be found almost anywhere in the world, especially Southeast Asia, North America, Australasia and France. The diaspora, at least estimated, contains over 10 million people, which is as much as the population of Chaoshan itself. They speak a language closely related to Hokkien, and their Teochew cuisine is distinctive. The ancestors of the Teochew people moved to present-day Chaoshan from the Central Plains of China in order to escape from a series of civil wars during the Jin Dynasty. As was recorded in pedigrees and ancient inscriptions, these people who had originally migrated to southern Fujian, especially from Quanzhou and Putian, made settlements toward Chaoshan in batches and soon spread all over the Chaoshan area. Geographic isolation and difficulty in traveling in the past made the Helao or Fulao become a relatively closed population. Recently, studies of genetic analysis supported that although all Han Chinese are indeed related and share a common root, the Teochew had closest links with the Minnan area of Fujian province and those from

The terrain is mostly level, but some areas are dissected with substantial canyons and drainages, though none of the upland areas are high or large enough in areas to be considered mountains. grows in the climate of Del Rio. The climate is semi-arid in moisture and subtropical in temperature. Humidity is more often high than low, with periodic morning fog due to Gulf of Mexico airmasses moving northwest into the area. This gives Del Rio and adjacent areas the effect of being in a coastal dryland area, even though the Gulf of Mexico is over away. Such humid periods alternate with periods of hot and dry desert airmasses in the spring and fall, or cold and dry great plains airmasses during winter months. Moisture rarely lasts long enough for weather systems to react with it to create much precipitation, as happens more frequently not far to the north and east of the area; there are exceptions during some autumns (tropical weather systems) and spring

health	Anemia	 Sources and symptoms MAC bacteria are common in the environment and cause infection when inhaled or swallowed. Symptoms of MAC diseases are reminiscent of tuberculosis. They include fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Many patients will have anemia and neutropenia if bone marrow is involved. Pulmonary involvement is similar to TB, while diarrhea and abdominal pain are associated with gastrointestinal involvement. MAC should always be considered in a person with HIV infection presenting with diarrhea. Recently, M. avium has been found to deposit and grow in bathroom shower heads from which it may be easily aerosolized and inhaled.
health	Anesthesiologist	In the pre-operative holding area, the patient changes out of his or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details of his or her surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover all of the patient's body except for the head and the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an "ether screen", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist's working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).

history	Archaeology	Frothingham lectured at Princeton when it was still known as the College of New Jersey (1885). In 1886, he became a professor there, teaching art history and archaeology, although it is rumored that he took no salary at first. Among his courses were offerings in renaissance art history, among the first post-classical art courses taught at the College. Together with Allan Marquand, Frothingham worked to rewrite Moritz Carrière's Bilder Atlas as a fourth volume of the Iconographic Encyclopedia (1887). About 1890, Frothingham and Marquand began to have major difficulties working together, perhaps stemming from the overlap in their areas of expertise and teaching. Frothingham taught his renaissance course (which was largely medieval monuments) for the last time in 1892-93.

history	American_Swedish_Historical_Museum	Reports reports from early Swedish emigrants to North America painted the American Midwest as an earthly paradise, and praised American religious and political freedom and undreamed-of opportunities. The Swedish West India Company had established a colony on the Delaware River in 1638, naming it New Sweden. A small, short-lived colonial settlement, New Sweden contained at its height only some 600 Swedish and Finnish settlers (Finland was then part of Sweden). It was lost to the Dutch in New Netherland in 1655. Nevertheless, the descendants of the original colonists maintained spoken Swedish until the late 18th century. Modern day reminders of the history of New Sweden are reflected in the presence of the American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia, Fort Christina State Park in Wilmington, Delaware, and Printzhof in Essington, Pennsylvania.

history	Alexander_Cunningham	One of the ancient civilizations on archaeological evidence dated 3000 to 5000 B.C. south-west from downtown in suburb of Harapa which was the northern city of Indus Valley Civilization. Harrapa is now a large village in the Sahiwal Division of Punjab, southwest of the district capital. Archaeologists think that in ancient times Harappa was the urban centre in the upper Indus region, much like Mohenjo-daro dominated the lower Indus Valley and Ganweriwala might have been the urban centre for what is now Rajasthan. The site at Harappa was first excavated by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1872-73, two decades after Brick Robbers carried off the visible remains of the city. He found an Indus Seal of an unknown origin.

history	Archaeology	Recently, an archaeologist examining sediment cores found pollen from coconut palms deep below the bottom of the central lagoon. This unexpected find raises several issues. Heretofore, no evidence existed that the coconut ever reached any of the Hawaiian Islands before the arrival of the Polynesian voyagers. Further, there has never been any physical evidence that the ancient Hawaiians extended their explorations of the Hawaiian chain beyond Nihoa and Mokumanamana (Necker). Dating the sediment containing the Cocos pollen is imprecise, but appears to be somewhere between 5,500 years ago, and the arrival of Europeans in Hawaiian waters in the late 18th century. The full length of the core was and is thought to represent a record spanning 7,000 years. Coconut pollen was not found in the deeper (older) part of the core. However, cores from Guam in the western Pacific show the presence of coconut trees there as early as 9,000 years ago, well before human habitation. Hawaiian traditions suggest that the Hawaiians were aware that islands existed to the northwest, and the pollen evidence could be interpreted as proof of early Hawaiian visitation to Laysan. Clearly, more precise dating of the sediment layers will be crucial to better interpreting this find.

His family was Irish-Catholic, with his mother in particular being extremely devout and homophobic. Brian had an unstable childhood due to his father being an abusive alcoholic. Brian was physically abused by his father throughout his childhood and teenage years; it is unclear whether Jack was also abusive to Brian's older sister, Claire. During his high school years, Brian would escape the abuse in his home by staying with his best friend, Michael Novotny, whose mother, Debbie Novotny, ultimately began treating Brian like another son. After high school, Brian received a full scholarship to Penn State, where he studied advertising.

law	Affinity_%28canon_law%29	bishop may declare the marriage null without the participation of the defender. In view of the new matrimonial legislation contained in the decree "Ne Temere" of Pius X this also holds anywhere if a marriage is attempted only before a civil authority or non-Catholic minister of religion. Yet if an ecclesiastical form had been used, and the nullity from clandestinity was questioned, his presence is required; but if the impediment of clandestinity clearly appears he need not appeal. This is true also if, through absence of ecclesiastical dispensation, there is an impediment of disparity of worship, or of consanguinity, or of affinity from lawful intercourse, or of spiritual relationship, or of certain previous legitimate marriage still existing. In these cases the ordinary may, with the participation of the defender, declare the marriage null, and the defender is not required to appeal. This, however, was declared by the Holy Office (27 May 1901) to be understood only of cases in which certainly and clearly the impediment is proven; otherwise the defender must proceed to the higher court. The defender is exhorted to exercise his office gratuitously, but he may be compensated from fees imposed by the court or from other diocesan resources.

mathematics	Arithmetic	Course of study Shōgakkō or Elementary school class in Japan The ministry's Course of Study for Elementary Schools is composed of a wide variety of subjects, both academic and nonacademic, including moral education and "special activities." "Special activities" refer to scheduled weekly time given over to class affairs and to preparing for the school activities and ceremonies that are used to emphasize character development and the importance of group effort and cooperation. The curriculum includes Japanese language, social studies, arithmetic, and science. Nonacademic subjects taught include art (including Japanese calligraphy) and handicrafts, music, homemaking, physical education, and moral education. Japanese language is an emphasized subject. The complexity of the written language and the diversity of its spoken forms in educated speech (keigo)(敬語) require this early attention.
mathematics	Axiom_of_choice	In 1976, R. M. Solovay proved (building on work of H. Woodin) that there is at least one model of ZFC (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory + axiom of choice) in which Kaplansky's conjecture is true. Necessarily, in such a model the continuum hypothesis is false. Combined with the results of Dales and Esterle, this shows that the conjecture is independent of the axioms of ZFC.

mathematics	Babylonian_mathematics	Examples of Pythagorean triples include (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13). There are infinitely many such triples, and methods for generating such triples have been studied in many cultures, beginning with the Babylonians and later ancient Greek, Chinese and Indian mathematicians. The traditional interest in Pythagorean triples connects with the Pythagorean theorem; in its converse form, it states that a triangle with sides of lengths a, b and c has a right angle between the a and b legs when the numbers are a triple. Right angles have various practical applications, such as surveying, carpentry, masonry and construction. Fermat's Last Theorem is an extension of this problem to higher powers, stating that no solution exists when the exponent 2 is replaced by any larger integer.
mathematics	Angular_momentum	In the vector field version continuous translational symmetry does not imply reflectional symmetry: the function value is constant, but if it contains nonzero vectors, there is no reflectional symmetry. If there is also reflectional symmetry, the constant function value contains no nonzero vectors, but it may contain nonzero pseudovectors. A corresponding 3D example is an infinite cylinder with a current perpendicular to the axis; the magnetic field (a pseudovector) is, in the direction of the cylinder, constant, but nonzero. For vectors (in particular the current density) we have symmetry in every plane perpendicular to the cylinder, as well as cylindrical symmetry. This cylindrical symmetry without mirror planes through the axis is also only possible in the vector field version of the symmetry concept. A similar example is a cylinder rotating about its axis, where magnetic field and current density are replaced by angular momentum and velocity, respectively.

mathematics	Arithmetic	Description He routinely completed several kinds of tasks that appeared to involve complicated thinking. For example, in response to apparently random requests from the audience, either he could actually do simple arithmetic and spell many words (using individual numbers and letters on wooden squares), or he was so well trained that hundreds of sizable audiences were successfully deceived into believing that they had seen him accomplish those feats. Either way, Beautiful Jim Key was apparently a very special horse.
mathematics	Aspherical_space	The Whitehead conjecture is a claim in algebraic topology. It was formulated by J. H. C. Whitehead in 1941. It states that every connected subcomplex of a two-dimensional aspherical CW complex is aspherical.
mathematics	Arithmetic	At that time, the University of Berlin, not Göttingen, was the leading center for mathematical research in Germany. Thus Dedekind went to Berlin for two years of study, where he and Riemann were contemporaries; they were both awarded the habilitation in 1854. Dedekind returned to Göttingen to teach as a Privatdozent, giving courses on probability and geometry. He studied for a while with Dirichlet, and they became close friends. Because of lingering weaknesses in his mathematical knowledge, he studied elliptic and abelian functions. Yet he was also the first at Göttingen to lecture on Galois theory. Around this time, he became one of the first to understand the fundamental importance of the notion of groups for algebra and arithmetic.
mathematics	1000000000_%28number%29	An order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable whose precise value is unknown is an estimate rounded to the nearest power of ten. For example, an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion (such as the human population of the Earth) is 10 billion. To round a number to its nearest order of magnitude, one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer. Thus 4,000,000, which has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602, has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude, because "nearest" implies rounding rather than truncation. For a number written in scientific notation, this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten (about 3.162). For example, the nearest order of magnitude for 1.7 × 108 is 8, whereas the nearest order of magnitude for 3.7 × 108 is 9. An order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a zeroth order approximation.

mathematics	Arboricity	triangle-free. In a graph with m edges, there may be at most Θ(m3/2) triangles; the worst case occurs when G is itself a clique. Therefore, algorithms for listing all triangles must take at least Ω(m3/2) time in the worst case, and algorithms are known that match this time bound. For instance, describe an algorithm that sorts the vertices in order from highest degree to lowest and then iterates through each vertex v in the sorted list, looking for triangles that include v and do not include any previous vertex in the list. To do so the algorithm marks all neighbors of v, searches through all edges incident to a neighbor of v outputting a triangle for every edge that has two marked endpoints, and then removes the marks and deletes v from the graph. As the authors show, the time for this algorithm is proportional to the arboricity of the graph (a(G)) times the number of edges, which is O(m a(G)). Since the arboricity is at most O(m1/2), this algorithm runs in time O(m3/2). More generally, all k-vertex cliques can be listed by a similar algorithm that takes time proportional to the number of edges times the (k − 2)nd power of the arboricity.
mathematics	Analysis_of_variance	In 1931 Yates was appointed assistant statistician at Rothamsted Experimental Station by R.A. Fisher. In 1933 he became head of statistics when Fisher went to University College London. At Rothamsted he worked on the design of experiments, including contributions to the theory of analysis of variance and originating Yates' algorithm and the balanced incomplete block design.
mathematics	Alfred_Tarski	To avoid the intricacies of set theory, Alfred Tarski has fashioned a Euclidean geometry without lines in his system of Tarski's axioms, content that the geometrical meaning of a line is sufficiently represented by logical collinearity.
mathematics	Axel_Thue	Liouville's result was improved by Axel Thue and others, leading in the end to a definitive theorem of Roth: the exponent in the theorem was reduced from n, the degree of the algebraic number, to any number greater than 2 (e.g. 2 + ε). Subsequently, Wolfgang M. Schmidt generalised this to the case of simultaneous approximation. The proofs were difficult, and not effective. This means that we cannot use the results or their proofs to obtain bounds on the size of solutions of associated diophantine equations. However, the techniques and results can often be used to bound the number of solutions of such equations.
mathematics	Applied_mathematics	In applied mathematics, the curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that some problems become intractable as the number of the variables increases. Simply put, it's just a fancy name for the idea that data spreads out exponentially with the number of dimensions; you will get a immense sparsity of data with very high dimensional spaces.

It was the first Steppenwolf album to feature bass player Nick St. Nicholas. Although it was less critically acclaimed than their successful first two albums, Steppenwolf and Second, it contains a few well-known hits, such as "It's Never Too Late" and "Jupiter's Child", as well as the colossal "Rock Me," which had been featured in the 1968 film Candy. Although the band would be very successful in the early 1970s, 'At Your Birthday Party' was to be their last top ten album and features their last top ten single.

He believed he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990, if he reformed the original band and got them clean and sober. Aerosmith officially reformed in May of 1984 and hired Collins as their manager. After every major record label passed on signing Aerosmith to a recording contract in the summer of 1984, Collins, with the help of the infamous music attorney Brian Rohan, inspired legendary A&R man John Kalodner to sign Aerosmith to Geffen Records. The band toured extensively and created their first album after the reunion of the classic lineup in 1985, titled Done with Mirrors. However, the album wasn't the success they had hoped for, the band wasn't receiving mainstream publicity, and the drug addictions of the band members and their attempts to quit drugs on their own weren't working. Collins and his team, with the help of Dr. Louis Cox, orchestrated a drug and alcohol intervention on lead singer Steven Tyler. Tyler entered a drug rehabilitation program at the Carron Foundation in Pennsylvania that was extremely successful for him. The rest of the band members followed suit shortly thereafter.

Frédérique Petrides née Frédérique Mayer (b. 26 Sept 1903, Antwerp, Belgium; d. 12 Jan. 1983, Manhattan), was a Belgian-American conductor. In New York City, Petrides founded the Orchestrette Classique, an all-women's chamber orchestra, which existed from 1932 to 1943, premiered works by new American composers, such as Paul Creston, Samuel Barber and David Diamond; and gave five to six concerts annually in Carnegie Chamber Music Hall, now Weill Recital Hall; founded the Carl Schurz Park concert series on Manhattan's Upper East Side in 1958; founded the West Side Orchestral Concerts in 1962; founded the Hudson Valley Symphony Orchestra in Tarrytown, New York in the 1930's, and founded the Student Symphony Society in New York City in 1950. Ms. Petrides was also editor and publisher of the ground-breaking Women in Music newsletters, which, in the 1930's chronicled the activities of women musicians from the ancient Egyptian times to the then present and were published in New York and circulated internationally.. Petrides's accomplishments were followed and reviewed by leading critics and writers such as Virgil Thomson, H. Howard Taubman, Irving Kolodin, Olin Downes, Robert A.
performing_arts	Alexander_II_of_Russia	In 1862, Pugni composed the music for Petipa's Pharaoh's Daughter, produced in only 6 weeks for the Italian Prima ballerina Carolina Rosati. The production was so successful that it won for Petipa the position of Second Maître de Ballet. In 1864, Pugni composed the music for Saint-Léon's Little Humpbacked Horse, which itself was as successful as Pharaoh's Daughter. Although he did receive laurels for his score for Petipa's The Pharaoh's Daughter, Pugni's score for The Little Humpbacked Horse caused a sensation with the St. Petersburg balletomanes, as it was considered to be an homage to the traditional music of Russia. The march titled The Peoples of Russia from the last act of this ballet became a favorite of Tsar Alexander II (many of Pugni's marches and entr'actes were thus performed at Imperial balls and diplomatic functions).

Frédérique Petrides had learned that, in the 1930s, the only avenue open to women conductors was to establish their own orchestras.

Suffering from writer's block, he is unable to complete the play, but begins auditions for Romeo. A young man named Thomas Kent is cast in the role after impressing Shakespeare with his performance and his love of Shakespeare's previous work. Kent is actually Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), the daughter of a wealthy merchant who desires to act, but women are banned from the stage and she must disguise herself.

Damocles (; , Damoklēs; literally: "Fame of the People") is a figure featured in a single moral anecdote concerning the Sword of Damocles, which was a late addition to classical Greek culture. The figure belongs properly to legend rather than Greek myth. The anecdote apparently figured in the lost history of Sicily by Timaeus of Tauromenium (c. 356–260 BC). The Roman orator Cicero may have read it in Diodorus Siculus. He made use of it in his Tusculan Disputations, V. 61–2, by which means it passed into the European cultural mainstream.

philosophy	Arabic_alphabet	 Literature This tradition has inspired many Muslim poets, especially in India. In poetical language Muhammad is sometimes equated with the sun or the morning light. As such, part of a poem from Sana'i, a renowned early twelfth century Persian Sufi poet, reads: "the sun should split the moon in two". Jalal ad-Din Rumi, a renowned Persian-writing poet and mystic, in one of his poems conveys the idea that to be split by the Muhammad's finger is the greatest bliss the lowly moon can hope for and a devoted believers splits the moon with Muhammad's finger. Elaborating on this idea, Abd ar-Rahman Jami, one of the classical poets and mystics of Persia, plays with the shapes and numerical values of Arabic letters in a complicated way: The full moon, Jami says, resembles the Arabic letter for a circular m with the numerical value 40. When Muhammad split the moon, it became like two crescent-shaped n's (the Arabic letter for "n") whose numerical value is 50 each. This would mean that, thanks for the miracle, the value of moon had increased.
philosophy	Albert_Einstein	The mathematician Benjamin Peirce called mathematics "the science that draws necessary conclusions". David Hilbert defined mathematics as follows: We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise. Albert Einstein stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."

She then proceeds to analyze literature and art from the premise that the primary conflict in Western culture has always been between these binary forces.

He wrote and printed Comentarios to the works by Juan de Mena and Garcilaso de la Vega (1582 and 1574 respectively). When he was accused of having identified the influences of Græco-Latin classics in the lyrical work of the latter, thus diminishing his poetic originality, el Brocense said that he didn't consider a good poet whoever didn't imitate the classics. He also wrote a great number of Latin poems and scholia.

philosophy	Advertising	Debord starts his 1967 work with a revisited version of the first sentence with which Marx began his critique of classical political economy, Das Kapital. In a later essay, Debord will argue that his work was the most important social critique since Marx's work. Drawing from Marx, which argued that under a capitalist society the wealth is degraded to an immense accumulation of commodities, Debord argues that in advanced capitalism, life is reduced to an immense accumulation of spectacles, a triumph of mere appearance where "all that once was directly lived has become mere representation". The spectacle, which according to Debord is the core feature of the advanced capitalist societies, has its "most glaring superficial manifestation" in the advertising-mass media-marketing complex.
philosophy	270_BC	Life Hermarchus was a son of Agemarchus, a poor man of Mytilene (in insular Greece), and was at first brought up as a rhetorician, but afterwards became a faithful disciple of Epicurus, who left to him his garden, and appointed him his successor as the head of his school, about 270 BC. He died in the house of Lysias at an advanced age, and left behind him the reputation of a great philosopher. Cicero has preserved a letter of Epicurus addressed to him.
philosophy	Aristotle	According to Aristotle's conception of epideixis, “the present is the most important; for all speakers praise or blame in regard to existing qualities, but they often make use of other things, both reminding of the past and projecting the course of the future” (Rhet. 1358b). Epideixis is Aristotle's least favored and clearly defined topic. Now considered to be the stuff of ceremonies with its exhortations, panegyrics, encomia, funeral orations and displays of oratorical prowess, epideictic rhetoric appears to most to be discourse less about depth and more attuned to style without substance. Still, the Art of Rhetoric is cited as an example of epideictic work (Lockwood, 1996).
philosophy	Ambiguity	In common usage, "ridiculousness" is used as a synonym for absurdity or nonsense. Historic and technical usage of "absurdity" associates it with invalid argumentation and reasoning. Historic and technical usage of "nonsense" associates it with semantics and meaning. While historic and technical usage of "ridiculous" associates it with laughter, superiority, deformity, and incongruity. Reductio ad absurdum is a valid method of argument, while reductio ad ridiculum is invalid. Argument by invective declaration of ridiculous is invalid, while arguments involving declarations of nonsense may summarize a cogent semantic problem with lack or meaning or ambiguity.

philosophy	Agape	The most famous example of an allegorical work from the Renaissance is probably Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene. In book 4 Agape has three sons, Priamond (from one), Diamond (from two), and Telamond (from téleios, perfect, but emended by Jortin to Triamond in his 1734 edition). The three sons correspond to the three worlds, born of love. Cambell's battle with the three sons is an allegory of "man's battle with the three worlds to find his place in the universe, to establish harmony in God's creation, and ultimately to achieve salvation" . Furthermore, since any triad may be an analogue of another, the three brothers could also be an allegory of the three worlds of man's soul: the vegetative, the sensitive, and the angelic".
philosophy	Agathias	Meleager's Anthology was popular enough that it attracted later additions.Prefaces to the editions of Philippus of Thessalonica and Agathias were preserved in the Greek Anthology to attest to their additions of later poems. The definitive edition was made by Constantine Cephalas in the 10th century, who added a number of other collections: homoerotic verse collected by Straton of Sardis in the 2nd century AD; a collection of Christian epigrams found in churches; a collection of satirical and convivial epigrams collected by Diogenianus; Christodorus' description of statues in the Byzantine gymnasium of Zeuxippos; and a collection of inscriptions from a temple in Cyzicus.
philosophy	Alexis_de_Tocqueville	Comparative history is the comparison of different societies which existed during the same time period or shared similar cultural conditions. The comparative history of societies emerged as an important specialty among intellectuals in the Enlightenment in the 18th century, as typified by Montesquieu, Voltaire, Adam Smith, and others. Sociologists and economists in the 19th century often explored comparative history, as exemplified by Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, and Max Weber. In the first half of the 20th century, a large reading public followed the comparative histories of Oswald Spengler, Pitirim Sorokin, and Arnold J. Toynbee. Since the 1950s, however, comparative history has faded from the public view, and is now the domain of specialized scholars working independently. Recent exemplars of this approach include American sociologist Barrington Moore and historian Herbert E. Bolton; British historians Arnold Toynbee and Geoffrey Barraclough; and German historian Oswald Spengler. Several sociologists are prominent in this field, including Max Weber, S. N. Eisenstadt, Seymour Martin Lipset, Charles Tilly, and Michael Mann.
philosophy	1486	 Achintya-Bheda-Abheda (अचिन्त्य भेदाभेद, in IAST) is a school of Vedanta representing the philosophy of inconceivable one-ness and difference, and also between God and his energies within the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious tradition. In Sanskrit achintya means 'inconceivable',(1486 - 1534) and differentiates the Gaudiya tradition from the other Vaishnava Sampradayas. It can be best understood as integral monism, as a position between the opposites of absolute monism of Adi Sankara's Advaita, and the dualist monism of Ramanujacarya's Vishishtadvaita.
philosophy	Allegory	Christian elements Lewis, himself an expert on allegory, did not consider The Chronicles of Narnia allegory. He saw them as "suppositional" answering the question, "What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours? This is not allegory at all." While not allegorical, Narnia does present significant parallels with elements from Christianity.
philosophy	Alasdair_MacIntyre	Alasdair MacIntyre, while he was born and educated in the United Kingdom, has spent around forty years living and working in the United States. He is responsible for the resurgence of interest in virtue ethics, a moral theory first propounded by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. He is considered the preeminent Thomist political philosopher. He holds that "modern philosophy and modern life are characterized by the absence of any coherent moral code, and that the vast majority of individuals living in this world lack a meaningful sense of purpose in their lives and also lack any genuine community". He recommends a return to genuine political communities where individuals can properly acquire their virtues.

physics	121_Hermione	as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid has a number of extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3 km) and Karoo (33.4 km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of 253 Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.

psychology	Anal_eroticism	to heart will be more likely to form a pattern of behavior that suits the child to avoid the challenges put forth by a malign social environment. The means that the child invents to make the best of a hostile environment. Although this may serve the child well while in that bad environment, it may also cause the child to react in inappropriate ways, ways damaging to his or her own interests, when interacting with people in a more ideal social context. Major trauma that occurs later in life, even in adulthood, can sometimes have a profound effect. See post-traumatic stress disorder. However, character may also develop in a positive way according to how the individual meets the psychosocial challenges of the life cycle (Erikson). Theories Freud Freud's first paper on character described the anal character consisting of stubbornness, stinginess and extreme neatness. He saw this as a reaction formation to the child's having to give up pleasure in anal eroticism.The positive version of this character is the conscientious, inner directed obsessive. Freud also described the erotic character as both loving and dependent. And the narcissistic character as the natural leader, aggressive and independent because of not internalizing a strong super-ego.

psychology	Autism_Diagnostic_Interview-Revised	The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule is an instrument for diagnosing and assessing Autism. It was created by Catherine Lord, Ph.D., Michael Rutter, M.D., FRS, Pamela C. DiLavore, Ph.D., and Susan Risi, Ph.D. in 1989 and became commercially available in 2001 through the WPS, or Western Psychological Services. The protocol consists of a series of structured and semi-structured tasks that involve social interaction between the examiner and the subject. The examiner observes and identifies segments of the subject's behavior and assigns these to predetermined observational categories. Categorized observations are subsequently combined to produce quantitative scores for analysis. Research-determined cut-offs identify the potential diagnosis of autism or related autism spectrum disorders, allowing a standardized assessment of autistic symptoms. The Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), a companion instrument, is a structured interview conducted with the parents of the referred individual and covers the subject's full developmental history. The ADOS should not be used for formal diagnosis with individuals who are blind, deaf, or otherwise seriously impaired by sensory or motor disorders, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy.
psychology	Able-bodied	 Able-bodied refers, in law , to an individual's physical or mental capacity for gainful employment or military service , and it is in this sense that the term is also used regarding eligibility for payment of child support or alimony . The term is also used by disability rights activist s and their supporters to refer to those who function " normally " in society and do not have an outward physical disability . In these circles, particularly amongst those who more closely align themselves with the "identity" of disability, 'able-bodied' is sometimes abbreviated in speech and/or writing to "AB", as in "that AB person over there". "AB" can even sometimes be used in a condescending and/or disparaging manner, as if to suggest a certain level of 'disability supremacy' because of disabled individuals' sometimes markedly-different perspectives on the physical world and their place in it. In that context "able-bodied" is seen almost as a type of immaturity due to the able-bodied person's lack of disability experience. The term "nondisabled" is considered by some to be preferable to the term "able-bodied" because it moves "disability" from a marginalized to a centralized topic of discourse. Others, however, question the necessity of using
psychology	Beta-endorphin	Concerning hallucinogenic states brought about by chronic hypoxia, Dr. E L Lloyd notes that they may be similar to the hallucinations experienced by climbers at altitude. He further notes that no such state occurs in hypoxia brought about by sudden aircraft decompression at altitude. These findings suggest to him that they do not arrive purely from a lack of oxygen. Upon examining the studies on hypoxia he found that "abnormalities in the cerebral neurochemistry involving one or more of the interconnected neurotransmitters, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and β-endorphin had been reported in all the conditions associated with hallucinations."

psychology	Anti-rape_movement	Anti-rape movementots of the Movement In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new conceptualization of rape arose out of the second-wave feminist movement, which served as a foundation for the anti-rape movement to come. Within the movement, feminists began a reevaluation of women's daily lives socially and with regard to the societal institutions with which they interact. Prior to this reexamination, rape had been viewed as a “…sex crime carried out by pathological men,” who were unable to control their own sexual desires. Feminists began to argue something radically different, instead emphasizing the role of power dynamics specifically with regard to the perpetration of rape as a crime committed primarily by men against women. This updated definition of rape was meant to come from the perspective of the victim. The act of rape was asserted to be a way in which societal gender role s, the way someone acts out either masculinity or femininity, were enforced and the hierarchy of power placing males above females was maintained. Rape was thus defined as a form of violence used to ensure male power, a form of social control over women. Known as the “anti-rape” or “rape prevention” movement, it was founded with

He was described as a "champion sleeper", even falling asleep with food in his mouth occasionally. A paper delivered to the Society of Clinical Psychologists hypothesized that Jackson had Asperger syndrome, although other possible explanations exist. Indeed Jackson suffered a number of ailments, for which he sought relief via contemporary practices of his day including hydrotherapy, popular in America at that time, visiting establishments at Oswego, New York (1850) and Round Hill, Massachusetts (1860) although with little evidence of success. Jackson also suffered a significant hearing loss in both of his ears as a result of his prior service in the U.S. Army as an artillery officer.
psychology	Cane_toad	One of many themes in Mayanism related to shamanism is the use of entheogens to induce altered states of consciousness and thereby gain insight and wisdom. The most common medicinal plant used by the ancient Maya was tobacco (Nicotiana), which was ingested by smoking or drinking an infusion. The use of a number of psychotropic substances is well documented in the culture of ancient Mesoamerica. These include various mushrooms that contain psilocybin, the morning glory, (Ipomoea and Rivea corymbosa), the moonflower (Datura spp.), the water lily (Nymphaea), cohoba (Anadenanthera spp.), and the cane toad (Bufo marinus), a source of bufotenin, However, the importance of entheogens by the ancient Maya has been inferred primarily through the study of iconography rather than direct archaeological evidence. This includes representations of the administration of substances by enema in ancient Maya art. Some of these methodes have been also used for Miguel Ángel Ruiz, another author who has also used fake "Toltec" concepts in his books.

psychology	Betty_Eisner	into the use of LSD to treat alcoholism and maintained an active interest in hallucinogen s throughout her career. Along with Sidney Cohen, Eisner appears to have originated the practice of using simultaneous male and female therapists or researchers during human hallucinogen administration. Eisner was a therapist for Bill Wilson , co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous , when he tried LSD. In addition to using hallucinogens like LSD and mescaline in psychedelic therapy , Eisner also gave stimulants such as methylphenidate and the inhaled gas mixture carbogen to her patients. However, Eisner's interest in finding new tools for psychotherapy was not limited to drugs. Eisner was particularly focused on extra-pharmacological variables that she felt influenced outcome of psychotherapeutic sessions. She considered the specific individuals present as an important variable in therapeutic outcome and sometimes conducted sessions in group settings. Some of these group sessions included "encounter group"-style expression and body work. Eisner also described the psychotherapeutic importance of a variable she called 'matrix.' This term encompassed the everyday living space and larger social context in which the patient lived and returned to between sessions. Betty Eisner's publications and personal correspondence are archived at Stanford University. Category:1915 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Psychologists Category:Psychedelic researchers

religion	Adir_Hu	 Adir Hu (English: Mighty is He, Hebrew אדיר הוּא) is a hymn sung by Jews worldwide at the Passover Seder . It switches rapidly between saying the virtues of God in an alphabet format ( Aleph , Bet , Gimmel ,...), and expressing hope that God will "rebuild the Holy Temple speedily." Most of the virtues of God are adjectives (for instance, Holy (Kadosh) is he); however, a few are nouns. (Lord is he). Adir Hu is sung towards the end of the Seder. The traditional melody is a bouncy, major one. Other melodies, however, have been composed for the alphabetical song. History The tune of Adir Hu has gone through several variations over the years, but its origin is from the German minnesinger period . The earliest existing music for Adir Hu is found in the 1644 "Rittangel Hagada". The second form is found in the 1677 "Hagada Zevach Pesach", and the third and closest form can be found in the 1769 "Selig Hagada".

In technical drawing, moving parts are, conventionally, designated by drawing the solid outline of the part in its main or initial position, with an added outline of the part in a secondary, moved, position drawn with a phantom line (a line comprising "dot-dot-dash" sequences of two short and one long line segments) outline. These conventions are enshrined in several standards from the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, including ASME Y14.2M published in 1979.

sport	1930%E2%80%9331_in_English_football	During the 1930–31 season, City manager Peter Hodge decided that Busby's talents could be better exploited from the half-back line, In 1930, Manchester United made an enquiry about signing Busby from their cross-town rivals, but they were unable to afford the £150 fee that City demanded. By the 1931–32 season, Busby was firmly established in the first team, missing just one match that season. Indeed, Busby and Jackie Bray became such fixtures at wing-half that club captain Jimmy McMullan had to move to forward to keep his place in the team. In the 1930s Manchester City performed strongly in the FA Cup. They reached the semi-finals in 1932, and the final in 1933 before finally winning the tournament in 1934. However, from the second half of the 1934–35 season, Busby's number 4 jersey was worn by Jack Percival with increasing regularity, and Busby was sold to Liverpool for £8,000 on 12 March 1936, having made more than 200 appearances for Manchester City.

Its first game was played on October 23, 1926, a 7-0 win over Rollins College before 304 fans. Under the guidance of head coach Howard Buck, the freshman team posted a perfect 8–0 record in its inaugural season. Two of the wins were against the University of Havana, one on Thanksgiving Day in Miami and one at Havana on Christmas Day. Miami's last home game at of the season featured a first: the first Hurricane football game played on New Year's Day against Howard at Miami's University Stadium. Around this time, the team adopted the official nickname "Hurricanes," though the exact timing and origin of the name is unclear; some reports suggest it was in reference to the devastating power of the 1926 hurricane that postponed the program's first game by a month, and others that it was suggested by a player in response to rumors that university officials wanted to name the team after local flora or fauna.
sport	1928_National_Challenge_Cup	Towards the latter portions of the 1920s an period in American soccer known as the "American Soccer Wars" ignited. The Soccer Wars regarded the internal conflicts with the American Soccer League and their affiliated clubs participating in the National Challenge Cup. The debate involved whether the United States Football Association or the American Soccer League was the true chief organization of American soccer at the time, and consequently wrecked the reputation and possibly even the popularity of the sport domestically. The colloquial "war" has been considered responsible for the fall of the ASL, and the end to the first golden age of American soccer. This new tournament, or playoffs, would permanently cap the number of clubs entering this premier competition, unlike the National Challenge Cup, which the tournament was open to any USFA-affiliated team. Due to such reasons, three teams, Bethlehem Steel, the New York Giants S.C. and the Newark Skeeters, rejected the proposal, played in the 1928 National Challenge Cup and were subsequently suspended from the league and fined $1,000.

Elbel's lyric, "Champions of the West," refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship for the first time in the school's history. Snow was also the captain of the 1900 team, but his fame grew as a result of his role on the 1901 team, considered by some the greatest Michigan football team of all time. In Fielding H. Yost's first year as coach, Michigan finished 11–0, did not allow a single point to be scored by an opposing team, and outscored its opponents 550–0. The 1901 Wolverines became known as the "point-a-minute" team, as their offensive production resulted in an average of one point being scored every minute. The 1901 team was invited to play in the first Rose Bowl game on January 1, 1902, a 49–0 win over Stanford. Snow scored five touchdowns in the 1902 Rose Bowl, as follows: Five-yard run for a touchdown in the first half for the games first points Two-yard run for a touchdown in the second half to extend Michigan's lead to 22–0 Eight-yard run to extend the Michigan lead to 33–0 Seventeen-yard run to extend the Michigan lead to 38–0 Four-yard run to extend the lead to 44–0

Červeny of Graslitz was the first to use true rotary valves, starting in the 1840s or 1850s. Modern Piston valves were developed by Perinet for the saxhorn family of instruments promoted by Adolphe Sax around the same time. Pistons may either be oriented to point to the top of the instrument (top-action, as pictured in the figure at the top of the article) or out the front of the instrument (front-action or side-action). There are advantages and disadvantages to each valve style, but assertions concerning sound, speed, and clarity are difficult to quantify. German players generally prefer rotary valves while British and American players favor piston valves - the choice of valve type remains up to the performer.

Illumination festival in IIT Kharagpur. The outlines are made by earthen lamps. In addition to these cultural festivals, IIT Kharagpur and IIT Bombay celebrate unique festivals. IIT Kharagpur celebrates the Illumination festival on the eve of Diwali. Large bamboo structures (called chatais) as high as are made and earthen lamps (diyas) are placed on them to form outlines of people, monuments, or an event. The competition is held between hostels, it does not receive entries by outside visitors. Coupled with the Illumination festival is the Rangoli festival. In Rangoli, large panels showing an event or a concept, are made on the ground by fine powder, and sometimes even by crushed bangles or other innovative materials.
technology	1976_Dutch_Grand_Prix	Upon first tests by Jochen Mass, problems with the cooling were encountered and Coppuck had to redesign the radiator installation for more effective airflow. After the changes were made, Mass resumed testing the car, and the M26 made its debut at the Dutch Grand Prix that year in his hands. After the first race was completed with the car, it was decided amongst the team that the car needed further design work done, especially to the nose section and the M26 was not used again during 1976.
technology	Alfa_Romeo_Tipo_33	The year 1970 saw epic battles between the two teams and the many cars they entered, yet Porsche won all races except the 12 Hours of Sebring, where the victorious car and its drivers Ignazio Giunti/Nino Vaccarella/Mario Andretti had their origins in Italy. Ferrari decided to give up the 512 in 1971 in order to prepare the new Ferrari 312PB for the 1972 season, when only 3 litre class would be allowed. In addition to Porsche, the old national rival with its Alfa Romeo T33/3 also had won two races in 1971, and thus was ranked 2nd in the World Championship, above Ferrari.
technology	1964_in_aviation	In 1963 the Poles started production of the final variant of an attack plane, Lim-6bis. It had standard wings and single wheels, like the Lim-5 fighter. One important change was adding two underwing weapon pylons, close to the fuselage. Another change was adding a braking parachute container below a rudder. From 1963, these aircraft started equipping the Polish Air Force, but it was officially accepted only on September 14, 1964.
technology	1978_Swedish_Grand_Prix	 Brabham BT46B 'Fancar' The 1978 Swedish Grand Prix was a Formula One race held on June 17, 1978 at the Scandinavian Raceway ; it was the eighth race of the 1978 Formula One season . It is the only race entered and won by the Brabham "fan car". Race Summary The 1978 Swedish GP will be remembered for just one thing: the race itself being rather uneventful, it was the winning car that created its own footnote in history by dominating the meeting, thus to great lengths contributing to its uneventfulness in the first place. Responsible for this overwhelming coup was some clever thinking by Brabham 's Gordon Murray , who was trying to eclipse Colin Chapman 's ground effect invention on the Lotus 79 , the skirted car that had swept the front row since its debut at Zolder . Center of the new Brabham BT46B concept was a large fan which drew air through the engine water radiator which was mounted horizontally over the engine. The fan also took ground effect to a higher level (at least engineering-wise) by sucking air from under the car, creating a partial vacuum and creating an enormous amount of downforce . The car appeared to
technology	1956_in_aviation	Design and development The PZL-101 was a development of the Jakowlew Jak-12M, manufactured in Poland under licence from 1956. The main goal was to create an agricultural aircraft with increased useful load. Works were carried out by a team led by Stanisław Lassota. Behind two crew seats there was installed a container for 500 kg of chemicals, with a "hump" above a fuselage. Because a center of gravity moved rearwards, the plane was fitted with new, swept wings, with significant vertical end plates to improve air flow. Later, in most of the aircraft they were removed, because they increased side surface, making landing very tricky in crosswind. Main landing gear was also shifted rearwards, comparing with Yak-12. An equipment was simplified and lightened to increase useful load more, eg. a right door was removed.

technology	1995_in_motoring	1995 in motoringm Under the ownership of BMW , 1995 has been a very busy year for the Rover Group . The 200 Series has been re-launched in a smaller hatchback format. It is larger than superminis like the Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Corsa , but is designed as an upmarket competitor for the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra , justified by impressive equipment levels and comfort, which influence the inevitably higher prices. As the first in-house Rover design since the 1984 Montego , it is a very classy looking car which is only lacking in interior space when it comes to class-leading credentials. The new 400 Series is now an entirely different car to the 200 Series, whereas before it was a saloon version of the hatchback. This time it is a five-door hatchback or four-door saloon, with the hatchback being a rebodied version of the new British-built Honda Civic . The 400 Series, however, uses its own K-Series 16-valve engines which were very impressive on the original 1989 models and are still up with the best today. As with the new 200 Series, the 400 Series is fighting a size above its weight thanks to its high levels of equipment
technology	7-30_Waters	The range of calibers available for the Contender were limited, stopping just short of the .308 Winchester class cartridges. However, most any cartridge from .22 Long Rifle up to the .30-30 Winchester was acceptable, as long as the peak pressure of 48,000 CUP, or less, was placed upon the receiver. This flexibility prompted a boom in the development of wildcat cartridges suitable for the Contender, such as the 7-30 Waters and .357 Herrett and the various TCU cartridges, most of which were commonly derived on either the widely available .30-30 Winchester or .223 Remington cases. The largest factory caliber offered for the Contender was the .45-70, which although being a much larger case than the .308, was still feasible because of the relatively low cartridge pressure of the original black powder round relative to the bolt face of the Contender receiver. Custom gun makers also added to the selection, such as the J. D. Jones line of JDJ cartridges, based on the .225 Winchester and .444 Marlin. Other barrel makers pushed beyond the limits the factory set, and did chamber Contender barrels in lighter .308 class cartridges like the .243 Winchester. The Contender could also fire .410 bore shotgun shells, either through

technology	Afterburner	For take-off of the fixed wing aircraft, the Admiral Kuznetsov uses a ski-jump at the end of her deck. On take-off aircraft accelerate toward and up the ski-jump using their afterburners. This results in the aircraft leaving the deck at a higher angle and elevation than on an aircraft carrier with a flat deck and catapults. The ski-jump take-off is less demanding on the pilot, since the acceleration is lower, but results in a clearance speed of only 120–140 km/h (75-85 mph) requiring an aircraft design which will not stall at those speeds.
technology	1933_in_aviation	Development The prototype Courier was designed by Hessell Tiltman (co-founder of Airspeed Limited) and was built in 1932 by Airspeed at York for an attempt by Sir Alan Cobham to carry out a non-stop flight to India, using airborne refuelling. Airspeed moved from York to Portsmouth before the Courier G-ABXN first flew on 10 April 1933. The Courier was a wooden low-winged cabin monoplane, it had a novel feature for the day of a retractable undercarriage. The prototype being powered by an Armstrong Siddeley Lynx engine. The prototype had two minor accidents, in April 1933 at Portsmouth and in June 1933 at RAF Martlesham Heath. The aircraft was repaired on both occasions.
technology	1957_Formula_One_season	At the 1982 British Grand Prix, Brabham reintroduced the idea of re-fuelling and changing the car's tyres during the race, unseen since the 1957 Formula One season, to allow their drivers to sprint away at the start of races on a light fuel load and soft tyres. After studying techniques used at the Indianapolis 500 and in NASCAR racing in the United States, the team were able to refuel and re-tyre the car in 14 seconds in tests ahead of the race. In 1982 Murray felt the tactic did little more than "get our sponsors noticed at races we had no chance of winning", but in 1983 the team made good use of the tactic. Refuelling was banned for 1984, and did not reappear until the 1994 season (until it was banned again in 2010 as a part of cost cutting measures), but tyre changes have remained part of Formula One.

The only exceptions were the U.S. Highways and some of the New England Interstate Routes. Between 1922 and 1932, Connecticut used a state highway numbering system shared with the other New England states. Major inter-state trunk routes used numbers in the 1-99 range, primary intrastate highways used numbers in the 100-299 range, and secondary state highways used numbers in the 300+ range. In 1926, at the behest of the American Association of State Highway Officials , four of the nine New England Interstate Routes that passed through Connecticut became U.S. Routes . At this time, the adjacent states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island abandoned the New England highway numbering system but Connecticut still used it for several more years. This led to a situation where U.S. Routes were co-signed with New England Routes (in particular U.S. Route 5/New England Route 2 and U.S. Route 6/New England Route 3). In 1932, the Highway Department decided to abandon the New England numbering system as well by completely reorganizing the state highway system. The renumbering completely altered the

To advance to each new stage, the player had to collect stars, which would open the door to the next level. The proton gun was effective only on blocks at the character's feet, not on the ghosts (bombs were used to destroy the ghosts). If the player lost all his health (by touching damaging things like ghosts, flames, and reforming blocks), or the 999 second timer wound down to zero, the player would lose a life. After successful completion of a level, the player would be rewarded with a 4-digit password, which would enable them to start at the end of that level next time they played (the game had no save feature).

video_game	8-bit	The Retro Duo is a video game console developed by Retro-Bit and distributed by Innex, Inc. The Retro Duo is an 8-bit and 16-bit video game console. It was designed as an emulator to fit the needs of 8-bit and 16-bit console gamers and plays game cartridges for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES/Super Famicom. There have been quite a few clone systems made in recent years, but the difference with this one is that it plays American, European, and Japanese games and has the highest compatibility over any other clone system. Another notable difference is that S-video is now compatible when playing SNES games and it makes the games look noticeably better. The console is not licensed by Nintendo and is not fully compatible with every game released for the two game systems, however the majority of games will function properly. While it has only been released in Canada and the United States, it can still be used in Europe and Japan with a power plug adapter. The console is compatible with official and third party SNES controllers. The console can be purchased on many online stores, such as ThinkGeek.

video_game	Actua_Golf	Experienced with sports games (after the successful Actua Soccer and Premier Manager games), Gremlin required more additions to their sports range after releasing Actua Golf. As the Nagano Olympic Games were close, they acquired a license for the ice hockey tournament (which for the first time accepted proefessional athletes), making it the official video game, including real players. Market leader NHL '98, while adding for the first time national teams, only NHL players were real, but that was enough for the EA Sports franchise to top Gremlin's game in sales and critic appreciation (and eventually, even became one of the sports games of the year).
video_game	10NES	Nintendo was determined not to make the same mistakes in the US that Atari had. Because of massive influxes of games that were regarded as some of the worst ever created, gaming had almost completely died out in America. Nintendo decided that to avoid facing the same problems, they would only allow games that received their "Seal of Quality" to be sold for the Famicom, using a chip called 10NES to "lockout" or prevent unlicensed games from working.

video_game	Adhesive	The game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the stars, constellations and Moon, which his father, the King of All Cosmos, has accidentally destroyed. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains, until the ball has grown large enough to become a star. Katamari Damacys story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production. Overall, Katamari Damacy was well received in Japan and North America. (more...)

visual_arts	Accademia_degli_Incamminati	He was first instructed by his father at the Academy of the Incamminati, of the Carracci, at Bologna. After the successful woodblock printer Andrea Andreani died, Coriolano took his place. He worked at Bologna from 1630 to 1647, and was fond of developing the designs of Reni and Guercino. He usually made use of two blocks for his woodcuts; on one he cut the outline and the dark shadows, like the hatchings of a pen, and on the other block the demi-tinte, or "halftones". Coriolano's prints brought great recognition even though he contributed nothing new to the technique that he used.
visual_arts	Alicia_Grau_P%C3%A9rez-Agust%C3%ADn	 Spanish artist Alicia Grau Pérez-Agustín is an impressionist living painter who specializes in child and young women portraits. Born in Barcelona in 1955, she divides her working time between her hometown and Florence , Italy . Her style has been defined unmistakable by art critics for her excellent drawing technique, a measured use of pigments - through which the compact solidity of her textures causes her canvases take on a palpable sensation of volume - and the priming, the scraping and the thick layers of paints that she uses. Like realist painter Antonio Lopez Garcia, Alicia Grau Pérez-Agustín has succeeded in creating an artistic trend among the artists of her generation and her work is now spread throughout the world. During more than twenty years, she has held a great number of personal exhibitions in most Europe an and US capitals, and her works are today included in private and public art collections.

Hitchcock never won the Academy Award for Best Director. He was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in 1967, but never personally received an Academy Award of Merit. Through his fame, public persona, high degree of creative control and frequent return to favored themes, Hitchcock helped to transform the role of the director, which had previously been eclipsed by that of the producer. He is seen today as a director who managed to combine art and entertainment in a way very few have ever matched. His innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, producers, and actors. (continued...)
